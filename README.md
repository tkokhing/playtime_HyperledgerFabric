# Playtime with Hyperledger Fabric
This records my learning progression on Hyperledger Fabric

## Before We Begin

This is a continuation from [OneHeart project](https://github.com/tkokhing/OneHeart/blob/main/README.md) which I successfully built a blockchain prototype using Hyperledger Fabric. While the project has ended, here 4 milestones that i charted out to go deeper into building a blockchain. 

### 1. Configure IBM Blockchain Platform (IBP) on Different Machine

In the real-world, how likely that a new organization (Org B) wanting to join established blockchain network will request the primary organization (Org A) to setup the network for them? Further, Org B may have its own network (suppliers / contractors) to connect up. Therefore, the role of a developer varies.

Here, you are as Developer B building your end of the blockchain for Org B in order to join an existing network using a different (Linux Mint is what I used) machine. 

### 2. Develop Smart Contract in other languages with more complexity 

### 3. Create cloud native (client) applications to interface with the blockchain

### 4. Continue to research deeper into cybersecurity fences
