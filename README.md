This records my learning progression on Hyperledger Fabric

## What's Next for Me

The journey never stops. There are more to dive into. 
* configure IBP on different machine simulating a different org while adding more attributes and peers
* develop Smart Contract in other languages with more complexity 
* create cloud native (client) applications to interface with the blockchain
* continue to research deeper into cybersecurity fences
